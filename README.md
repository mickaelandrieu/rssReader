rssReader
=========

A simple javascript feedReader, use Google feed api to transform xml into json

How can I use it ?
==================

* Add rssReader.js in your HTML script.
* In your HTML, create an HTML Bloc ( ``html <div>, <p>, <section> `` ...) and add some options.

For each feed you want to parse and display, you have to describe 4 options:

* CSS class : 'post_results', can be overidded
* CSS id : as you like but necessary
* rss_num : number of feed to display
* rss_url: url of the feed

You've got a sample with this project.
